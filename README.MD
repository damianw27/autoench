# AutoEnch - World of Warcraft (3.3.5a) Addon

AutoEnch is an addon that enhances your enchanting profession experience in World of Warcraft. It introduces a convenient button to your enchanting interface, providing quick access to various enchanting actions.

## Credits

This project is based on the work of [CodeEntropy](https://legacy.curseforge.com/members/codeentropy/projects)

Original version of addon on Curse Forge: [AutoEnch](https://legacy.curseforge.com/wow/addons/autoench)

## Features:

- **One-Click Enchanting:**
  The button allows you to easily apply an enchant to your gear or Enchanting Vellum with a single click.

- **Enchant Queue:**
  Queue multiple enchants by clicking items in your inventory. Simply click items, and the enchants will be queued up for application.

- **Menu-Based Configuration:**
  Clicking the AutoEnch button for the first time reveals a dropdown menu, allowing you to customize the behavior of the button. You can also right-click on the button to set a new behavior.

- **Autoconfirm Same Enchant Replacements:**
  AutoEnch can automatically confirm replacements of the same enchant. To enable this feature, type `/ae AutoReplace` or `/ae AR`. Check the status by typing `/ae Help`. To disable, type `/ae NotReplace` or `/ae NR`.

## Note:
Enchanting actions cannot be fully automated due to restrictions on protected functions such as UseItem, which require a hardware event (mouse click). However, AutoEnch streamlines the process and offers customizable options to enhance your enchanting workflow.
